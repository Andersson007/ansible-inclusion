# ansible-inclusion
Requests to include new collections into the ansible package.

All new collections submitted for inclusion must satisfy the [Collection Requirements](https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst).
If there are any questions, feel free to ask for clarifications in the discussion described below and / or in the `#ansible-community` IRC channel.

Add a new Discussion with the Category: `New collection review`.  Please include the following information:

* Link to the galaxy page for the collection and to the collection repository.
* Any github IDs that should be notified if there is an issue with the collection and the bug tracker has not yielded information.
* Re-check that your collection satisfies the [Collection Requirements](https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst).
* Put a comment "The collection satisfies all the requirements and is ready for review" in the discussion.
